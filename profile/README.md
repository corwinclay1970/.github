## 🧠 My Approach to Development  

I believe in clean, well-documented code and maintainable architectures. My development process emphasizes:  
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Ensuring robustness through unit and integration tests.  
- **Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automating builds, tests, and deployments for faster iterations.  
- **Scalability**: Designing systems that can grow with user demand.  
- **Open Source**: Contributing to and learning from the global developer community.

## 🌱 Current Interests  

I’m currently exploring:  
- **Rust**: For its memory safety and performance.  
- **Edge Computing**: Building lightweight applications for edge devices.  
- **Data Engineering**: Optimizing data pipelines for real-time analytics.  
- **Machine Learning**: Experimenting with TensorFlow and PyTorch for small-scale AI projects.
